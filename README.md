# Hugo HTML5 UP Arcana

This is a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) port of the
[Arcana template](https://html5up.net/arcana) from
[HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/).
Check out the [live demo](https://sec.gd/hugo/themes/arcana/).

## Configuration
See the exampleSite folder. The elements on the homepage are defined in
`data/homepage.yml`, where you can choose which appear and configure them.
The mostly-empty `_index.md` files are required for marking of the active menu
item to work correctly.

You can add your own styles in your site's `assets/sass/custom.scss`, which is
included at the end of the theme's `main.scss`.

## Showcase
If you use this theme, let me know, and I'll list your site here!

Pull requests welcome! This is my first Hugo theme, and I expect there are some
things I've done sub-optimally.
